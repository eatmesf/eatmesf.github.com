      When I first moved to San Francisco several years ago, my diet consisted primarily of burritos and pizza. I kept only a handful of items in my refrigerator &ndash; beer, sausage, hot dogs, and more beer. Today I still love these foods but living here has (somewhat forcibly) broadened my horizons. I started eating vegetables, developed a taste for smoked fish, discovered sour beers, ate seitan from a truck, and tried beef tongue at a local pop-up restaurant. I don’t consider myself a &ldquo;foodie&rdquo; but I do bring a technical eye to these experiences through my value of science, minimalism and structure.

      Born in the south and raised in California, I prefer simple, homestyle food with a healthy/locavore twist. Though I’m no longer a strict vegetarian and eat many types of fish and seafood, I still enjoy vegetable-centric meals and seek organic and sustainably raised options when possible. I like my drinks strong and fruity and while I’ve embraced the mixology movement, sometimes there is nothing better than a classic margarita. To me, food and drink are much more than sustenance &ndash; if done right they are expression, emotion, adventure, balance and well-being all in one experience. Salud!
