U.S. News rates Maui as the #4 destiation worldwide for vacation destination.
A truely romantic destination, the island is one of the most isolated land masses on Earth.
There is no shortage of activities that fit the bill for even the most adventourous of people.
On the other hand, if laying back is your type of thing, Maui can be perfect for that too, from the rolling hills of rural Haiku to the resorts of Wailea.
That being said, night life of the island is sparse relative to that found in bigger cities.
