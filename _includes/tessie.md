I spend my days basking in the sun, sleeping on the couch, bed, chairs and
window sills, and observing the birds who visit our balcony. Every now and then
I chase a moth. Living in San Francisco has not changed my lifestyle too much,
though I do enjoy the cool, fresh air and occasional escape into the hallway of
our building. My favorite foods are greek yogurt, all kinds of ice cream and
salmon paté. My pastimes include being brushed and having my belly rubbed, but
whatever you do, don’t touch my paws!
