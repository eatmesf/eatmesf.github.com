When I first moved to San Francisco several years ago, my diet consisted
primarily of burritos and pizza. I kept only a handful of items in my
refrigerator -- beer, sausage, hot dogs, and more beer. Today I still love
these foods but living here has (somewhat forcibly) broadened my horizons. I
started eating vegetables, developed a taste for smoked fish, discovered sour
beers, ate seitan from a truck, and tried beef tongue at a local pop-up
restaurant. I donâ€™t consider myself a "foodie" but I do bring a technical eye
to these experiences through my value of science, minimalism and structure.
