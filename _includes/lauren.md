Born in the south and raised in California, I prefer simple, homestyle food
with a healthy/locavore twist.  Though I’m no longer a strict vegetarian and
eat many types of fish and seafood, I still enjoy vegetable-centric meals and
seek organic and sustainably raised options when possible. I like my drinks
strong and fruity and while I’ve embraced the mixology movement, sometimes
there is nothing better than a classic margarita. To me, food and drink are
much more than sustenance -- if done right they are expression, emotion,
adventure, balance and well-being all in one experience. Salud!
